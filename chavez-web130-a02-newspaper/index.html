                <h1>Treasury yields slide after largest one-day yield-gain in 2 weeks</h1>
                    <div>
                        <p>Treasury yields retreated on Monday as traders worried that a White House plan to overhaul the U.S. tax code would take longer than expected, and as polls showed a tighter race in a closely watched French presidential election, highlighting heightened geopolitical tensions.</p>

                        <p>Yields for 10-year government bond notes TMUBM USD 10 Y, -0.68%  fell 1.4 basis points to trade at 2.361%, after trading near a weeklong high of 2.387%. Yields for 30-year bonds TMUBM USD 30 Y, -0.38% also declined 1.1 basis point to 2.987%, while 2-year Treasury notes TMUBMUSD02Y, -0.95% fell 1.2 basis point to 1.274%.</p>

                        <p>Bond yields are inversely related to prices, and one basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point.</p>
